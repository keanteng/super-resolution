The SRGAN output in your image looks purple (or has a noticeable color shift) due to several common reasons in the training and inference process of SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network):

---

### ðŸ§  **1. Color Shift from Generator Artifacts**

SRGAN's generator sometimes introduces unnatural colors (e.g. purples, reds, greens) as it tries to hallucinate high-frequency textures. This happens because:

* The generator learns from pixel-wise loss (like MSE) **and** perceptual loss (e.g. using VGG features).
* Perceptual loss can prioritize texture/sharpness over color accuracy.
* GANs focus on realism, not necessarily faithfulness to the ground truth.

---

### ðŸŽ¨ **2. Imbalanced or Improperly Normalized Training Data**

If the images used during training were:

* Not normalized properly (e.g. `[-1, 1]` vs `[0, 1]` mismatches),
* Trained on a biased dataset with a certain hue dominance,
  the generator may develop a tendency to output off-color hues like purples.

---

### ðŸ“¸ **3. Upsampling + Activation Artifacts**

Upsampling layers (like PixelShuffle) followed by non-linear activations (like ReLU or Tanh) can introduce:

* Minor misalignments in channels,
* Amplification of certain frequency bands that manifest as purple.

---

### âœ… **4. SRGAN Model Limitation**

Unlike modern models (e.g. ESRGAN, Real-ESRGAN), SRGAN does not use **residual-in-residual dense blocks (RRDB)** or improved perceptual loss. As a result, SRGAN often:

* Produces less accurate textures,
* Has color fidelity issues (like purple tint).

---

### ðŸ”¬ Summary

The purple tint in your SRGAN output is likely due to **perceptual loss overfitting, dataset normalization artifacts**, and **SRGAN's architecture limitations**. It focuses on texture realism rather than accurate color reproduction.
