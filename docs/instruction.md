# Instruction for the Assessment

pls read the paper and understand them. 

this is the first paper SRCNN - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092

this is the second paper SRGAN 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802

Based on your understanding, reimplement the paper in pytorch. Both paper can use the same codebase, except certain part require some changes only. And check the result if u can get similar result as the paper or not. This one will require u to think logical to resolve some problem. and u will need to pay attention to detail as well. U can use ChatGPT in this test, but don't abuse it as I am gonna to question a lot of details. If u use ChatGPT to do all the works, u will not be able to answer my question
